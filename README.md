it determines how. strongly a time series is strongly defined by a trend. 

## Kwiatkowski–Phillips–Schmidt–Shin  Test  (KPSS Test)

It used for  stationarity of a 
series around a deterministic trend. 
Like ADF test, the KPSS test is also commonly used to analyse the stationarity of a series.

## One Way Anova Test
It is used to determine whether there are any statistically significant differences between the means of two or more independent (unrelated) groups

## Anomaly Detection with SVM 
Anomaly detection detects data points in data that does not fit well with the rest of the data.
SVM for anomaly detection is to find a function that is positive for regions with high density of points, and negative for small densities.
