## Augmented Dickey Fuller Test

This type of statistical test is called a unit root test.  The intution behind a unit root test is that
it determines how. strongly a time series is strongly defined by a trend. 

## Kwiatkowski–Phillips–Schmidt–Shin  Test 

It used for  stationarity of a 
series around a deterministic trend. 
Like ADF test, the KPSS test is also commonly used to analyse the stationarity of a series.

## Difference among these two tests

The capability of the KPSS test to check for stationarity in the ‘presence of a deterministic trend’.
It implies the slope of the trend in the series does not change permanently. That is even if the series goes through a shock, it tends to regain its original path.
